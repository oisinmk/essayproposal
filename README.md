## Title: A New World 




## Research Question:  Generation Z and why they need to be taken seriously





## Introduction

>"Some brands may disregard Gen Z as too young or too insignificant, but as CEO of Dairy Queen, I’ve already seen the impact this youthful audience holds. This cohort of teenagers influences the market financially, culturally, technologically, and economically—and this influence will only continue to grow.” John Gainor, the president and CEO of Dairy Queen. 

Generation Z are those people born between the mid-1990s to approx. 2005. The oldest are just beginning to enter the workforce. 

This essay explores how Generation Z impacts the world markets economically, culturally and technologically, argues that their influence can only continue to rise and looks at how, as designers, we can engage with for this new generation.

 
 



## Section 1:  Economic: Generation Z’s Spending Power and Influence
 


Even though the eldest of Generation Z are only now entering the workforce, they have significant spending power. According to a 2018 study by Barkley, the estimated direct spending power of Generation Z is $150 billion, this data was based on allowances and earnings from people aged between seven and twenty-one in the USA. However, the Barkley study elaborates that this spending power inflates to over $600 billion when Generation Z’s influence was accounted for.

Generation Z may not have as much spending power in comparison to their elder counterparts, but we need to take into account their spending influence. According to a 2015 study by Cassandra 93% of parents say their children impact family spending and buying for the household. According to the Journal of Consumer Marketing, when shopping with their children parents spend on average 30% more!

However, one thing to consider is that Generation Z are being sensible when it comes to money, according to a study by Business Insider, 64% of Generation Z have personal savings, which is 13% higher when compared to older savers. 

Designers need to be aware of what Generation Z take into consideration when they spend money.  For example, Joe Cardador, Barkley, suggests that, “Gender and racial equality are important to Gen Z, especially Gen Z females. Our research on the Youth Mindsets suggests that Gen Z females are looking for brands to be innovative and part of their social network, both online and off. This corresponds to their goals of projecting success through bringing new ideas and products to their networks.”



## Section 2:  Culture and Society: The Next Big Disrupters.



>“I was raised in a household where I was taught to ask myself “how am I going to make a difference?”  not “if I am going to make a difference.” I am a product of my environment, committed to change- making.” Ziad Ahmed. 

What cultural and societal power do Generation Z wield?

Generation Z have been moulded by the events that they grew up with. J. Walter Thompson of the Innovation group explains that Generation Z grew up during America’s “War on Terror” and the financial recessions of 2000 and 2008, Thompson suggests that this has a significant impact on how they see and act in the world and how they plan on changing it.

The “March for Our Lives” protest (March 18) took place in Washington’s Capitol Hill and throughout the rest of the USA. It was a student organized response to the Stoneman Douglas High School shootings that took place in February earlier that year. According to Business Insider it turned out to be one of the largest protests in American history, with an estimated between one and two million protesters across the USA. The protest has evolved into a movement to inspire, and currently, they are campaigning to encourage young people to vote in the USA according to the “March for Our Lives” website. 

In the UK, the “Vote at 16” movement is campaigning for the UK government to lower the minimum legal voting age to 16, to give the younger generation a voice in society. The Scottish government made the change in 2015 and according to research conducted by SPICe, saw a 75 percent turnout from people aged 16 and 17.

According to the research agency Wildness, Generation Z doesn’t want to be spoken for, but that they want to proactively engage in the production of meaning around them, including design elements that they’re going to buy into

Caroline Jacoby describes Generation Z as “The most culturally diverse population to date” and that they demand “openness and inclusivity… corporate values are no longer a nicety, but a necessity.” 

Generation Z want to see design that feels authentic and takes into consideration the whole community, and the individual. They are very aware of power of the social and cultural engagement for good.

>“It’s less a political stance than a practical reality, because Gen Zers are anything but monolithic in their beliefs”-Jacoby



## Section 3:  Technology: “Digital Natives”



Caroline Steiger labels Generation Z as “Digital Natives.” Steiger explains how Generation Z are the first generation to be born during or after the advancement of digital technology. Steiger elaborates that this has given Generation Z an innate grasp of technology and a “greater level of comfort” when using it.

 >“They are the most connected, educated and sophisticated generation in history. They don’t just represent the future, they are creating it.” Mark McCrindle. 

There is no doubt that they spend a lot on time using screens, they “invented the ability to hold a conversation and simultaneously scroll through their phones.” Iqbal, Guardian. What does Generation Z want when it comes to technology? A 2017 Report by American Express, states that 23% of Generation Z will leave a brand over badly-designed mobile features, they elaborate how Generation Z value efficiency and convenience and continues to suggest that designers should focus on functionality as well as design. 



### Conclusion

Generation Z may be the youngest generation, but they cannot be ignored. 
They have already amassed a significant spending power and a substantial influence on the spending of other generations. They will take up 40 percent of the global population by 2020. They speak up, fight for what they want, and they are not afraid to protest. They are “Digital Natives”, never far from a screen. They “Drink less, take far fewer drugs, and have made teenage pregnancy a near anomaly...Prefer juice-bars to pub crawls, rank quality family time ahead of sex and prioritize good grades before friendship.” Iqbal, Guardian. Iqbal also suggests that they are “know for being globally connected and politically anxious” and that they are “Big on experimenting with gender and sexual spectrums.”
These are the young people we need to think about when designing. Design for diversity, design collaboration, design for good, design for multiple devices.
